# Summary

Pyrgg is an easy to use synthetic random graph generator written in python, that support variant graph file formats include DIMACS.																										
Pyrgg has the ability to generate graphs in different sizes and designed to provide input files for 
test, benchmark and performance analysis of graph-processing frameworks, but it can be used in any other research program that include graphs with these formats.			

Graph Specifications :

- Weighted
- Signed
- Self Loop
- Parallel Arc
- Sparse
- Dense  

Supported Formats:

- DIMACS(.gr)
- CSV(.csv)
- JSON(.json)
- YAML(.yaml)
- Weighted Edge List(.wel)
- ASP(.lp)
- Trivial Graph Format(.tgf)
- UCINET DL Format(.dl)
- Pickle(.p)
