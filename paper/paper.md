# Summary
Pyrgg is an easy to use synthetic random graph generator written in python, that support variant graph file formats like DIMACS, JSON and CSV											
Pyrgg has the ability to generate graphs in different sizes and designed to provide input files for 
test, benchmark and performance analysis of graph-processing frameworks, but it can be used in any other research program that include graphs with these formats.			

Pyrgg can generate graphs with this specs :

- Weighted
- Signed
- Self Loop
- Parallel Arc
- Sparse
- Dense  

This application get :
					
- vertices number
- max weight
- min weight
- max edge number(for each vertex)
- min edge number(for each vertex)

and generate graph in flat file format
